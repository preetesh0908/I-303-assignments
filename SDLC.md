## SDLC
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is essentially the process in which a 
piece of software is developed and launched or put into production. Some SDLC Models even 
include the upkeep and maintenance of a piece of software. SDLC includes steps to success 
and the correct order in which to design, create, and test your code. Stackify describes 
SDLC as “SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software 
with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time. SDLC includes a detailed 
plan for how to develop,alter, maintain, and replace a software system.”[1]

## Models
Individualized pieces of SDLC are called Models. Models are specific, usually diagrammed, 
road maps for success in software development. Usually, a company or team will chose one 
SDLC Model to use as their standard, and then always develop with it, as long as it 
continues to be successful for them. There are two different types of SDLC Models, Linear 
and Iterative. Linear goes from one stage to the next, while Iterative Models repeat 
steps. [2]

## Transitional Requirements

In order to begin using a new system, it’s important to take into account a variety of 
prerequisites that must be addressed. These can be as simple as who will be using the 
system, up to how much training will required to use the software, as well as how in-depth 
the training needs to be in order for users to navigate the system successfully and 
efficiently. These are requirements that must be addressed when transitioning, or else 
people that use the system may fail to make use of it efficiently. 

## Requirements Analysis

A requirements analysis is important for any larger project as it requires users to 
identify their available resources, and decide how and where to use them. Essentially, 
this process can be broken down into three steps:
	
Eliciting Requirements - identify the requirements for a project
Analyzing Requirements - decide how the requirements will be met
Recording Requirements - making check points for each requirement identified

When identifying requirements, there are many ways to decide to gather including surveys, 
observation, and data trends. However, the easiest way to find a requirement is to just 
*know*[3]. Another useful way of gathering requirements is to embed yourself in the 
organization you are working with. By putting yourself in the companies shoes, you can 
accurately identify which requirements the project must have. By following these steps, 
you are ensuring your project will save time, stress, and potential loss of respect[4].

## Design

After gathering requirements one can then transition into the design phase. Design isn’t 
about how the implemented system will look, but rather how it can be accessed and how 
simple that process is. By identifying the requirements, one is generally able to have a 
better understanding of how the system is meant to be handled. These processes all stack 
on top of each other to create the final product.

Sometimes you aren’t designing tangible things- you can be designing system standards or 
specifications for an upcoming design. Other times you will be, such as a Database or 
backend architecture. [5]

## SDLCs
An **SDLC** is a *Software/Systems Development Lifecycle*, and they are incredibly 
important to most any developmental process. Why? Because it breaks down the entire 
process ver minutely, and in different ways, to make it flow more easily, easier to 
understand the individual phases, and plan things out more coherently [6].

**Important Note:*** These processes do not apply only to the development of new models 
and systems: they can apply to revising current products or even the maintenance of 
current systems!

##SDLC
SDLCs are essentially how "software/systems come to exist in the world... and how they are maintained" [7].  It ultimately helps all parties understand each step of software or system development. SDLCs have 7 phases: Planning, requirements, design, development, integration & testing, implementation, and operations & maintenance

##Development
Development is a broad term, and encompasses many topics within a system. Each system effectively has 5 types of development: systems, software, database, transitional and documentation.

##Systems Development
Systems development essentially is the hardware. Purchasing, configuring and setting up new hardware is important in that it allows the runtime to be optimized if using the most up to date machines.

##Software Development
This is effectively where software engineers come into play, hard coding things in the front and back ends of an information technology system. Because this role is so important, "software programmers can be subject to the bureaucracy of the actual system" which in turn "can add delays to the project" [8].

##Database Development
This is the backend of a system. Databases are crucial to any successful system, thus proper configuration of requirements are critical. As the name states, every database stores all a systems data, and thus is the part of the system that dictates what information gets stored, hence the requirements being crucial to a system's success.

##Transitional Development
While it's not explicit in terms of actual role, transitional development is crucial to having all data be readable and easily accessible. Transitional development involves things such as data cleansing, translation and analysis/change. (Python programmers love this kind of work)

##Doc Development
This is probably the most tedious of all the development cycles in a system. However, it also is probably the most crucial. Documentation is critical in that it denotes what people do and for what reason, thus constant updates of documentation can allow people to track mistakes without wasting unnecessary time.

## Quality Assurance
Quality Assurance (QA) is a fancy phrase for comprehensive testing of a system. It basically means to ensure that a system working and functioning properly, and according to its functional requirements. This is done in two ways: Automated Testing, and Manual Testing
 
### Manual Testing
It is manual and direct human testing of the system, which requires the checking of all inputs and outputs of the system. Although it seems to be too much monotonous work, it has further side effects, for example, it may prove that the system contains some errors and may not be as functional as was presumed, which may in return in losing the trust of a client.
 
### Automated Testing
Automated testing of a system is basically re-loading or rebooting of the system to ensure that there are no bugs or errors in the system. It is exponentially faster than manual testing and maintains consistency in results, more often than not.
 
### Training
Training in an SDLC cycle usually occurs between the QA stage and the Release stage. It, arguably, comes under the umbrella of QA as it considered to be a good practice as it gives an opportunity to validate functionality with actual users of the system, on a first-hand basis.
 
 
## Release
In the SDLC process/cycle, the Release stage is the last stage but is still an important and crucial stage as moving software to production can be a massive task, especially in environments where the software is critical to the business process. In other words, the release process is considered vital because it affects a business process significantly, thus being a risk if not done so carefully. The Release process also deals with what might be called the implementing of the system and may deal with the replacing of an older system.
