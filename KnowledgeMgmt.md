## The Hierarchy
Not all Data is the same: 
- it contains different information
- the information leads to different insights
- the data itself is different from other sets

But data points alone fail to provide 2 of those bullets- 2 of them are what is called 
*context*, or useful information gleaned from the set’s analysis [1]. For example, a set 
of exam scores or temperature data can provide great insights when combined together, 
but a single point tells you very little. All of this makes up *knowledge*, helping us 
connect the dots and come up with answers for relevant questions. 

As will be elaborated on, having this knowledge and not curating how it is used and 
stored can decrease its value and lead to its loss in the future [2].
