### The World

The world we live in is never still and constantly changing in ways we cannot immediately see; life. politics, legal, physical, climate, etc. 

The world changes faster and faster thanks to **Technology**, as it facilitates faster communication and the spread of ideas- it is an _agent_ of change. But, that's not to say that it can't change, as it certainly can. [1]

Recent changes can include things we have used in our lives but not thought much about:
- Digital payment cards/wallets (i.e. Apple Pay, Google Pay, Mastercard FastPay)
- Physical cards with wireless chips (i.e. Crimsoncard)
- Onine service registration (i.e. course registration)

Digial Wallets are great examples because they have been brought upon by many different causes and are going to be playing larger and larger roles in our lives. [2]

These things change and develop because of our needs, wants, and widening set of technological abilities. Concrete sources of change discussed in lecture are given below.

### New Hardware

New hardware is often integrated into new changes to keep up with software being developed for them. For example, a lot of information systems require servers, computers, and peripheral devices to accomodate for the software that a new information system offers.[1]

A lot of these accommodations then become the bottleneck for what we can and can’t do with our information systems presently and in the future. Upgrades in information systems can only go as far as the hardware that’s been built to house them. New versions of software can include new features, but you may not be able to use them with your current hardware in place.

Vendors will create best practices, or optimal ways to use the software that they’ve created. However, with changes to an information system, or a new information system altogether, a company will have to implement new training and education on the newest best practices. In lecture, it is described as our desire to innovate is what motivates us to make changes.[1]

### Risk

The reason we make changes to an information system is to mitigate our risk. We need to prevent our biggest/most frequent risks from occurring so that our business model as a whole does not fail.

Before making changes, the company must assess the possible risks of making the change itself in order to prevent acting that throws caution to the way, or in other terms, haphazard.[1]

## When is it important
Managing change is a big process, and more often than not, involves risk. And the bigger the number of users, the population, the bigger the risk. Therefore, one must take in account on how the the change can affect people 

Another important factor to consider with change is the money involved with it. It’s obvious that at the end of the day, a business is all about the money and profit, therefore, the last thing a business would want to spend, sometimes waste, its money is on the Information System, especially when there may be risks involved with it.

Another important factor to consider is the stakeholders involved with the change. In business, the IT Staff may, and generally, are not the only ones who are the stakeholders in changing an Information System. There are several parties that may be critically involved with the change, therefore, there it is important to involve and consult these stakeholders before implementing the change in the Information System.

## Changes in Software
Changes in software occur when the current software lacks the desired functionality, or could be changed for the betterment of the software. More often than not, new software is integrated when current software doesn’t meet consumer needs. An example of this was IU’s switch to canvas rather than its previous online software. Students were not happy with the way the current class structure functioned, and therefore, IU decided it was time to shift the software to a more up-to-date system that was easier to use[4].

## Failing Software
Changes in software often stem from current software *failure*. Failure can be defined in a multitude of ways according to software. It could mean the users were not satisfied with the way the system functioned, profits were not acquired, or the team felt that there wasn’t room for product expansion. Whatever the reason may be, failure is often caused by not meeting project requirements, failure to allocate the required resources, or team miscommunication.

## Strategies to Combat Failure
Failure can be combated. The first and most reliable way to combat failure is to plan accordingly. This is the pre-phase before and project takes place, and is usually the most important. This can be in the form of a project timeline, a list of stakeholders, or general resources required for the project to progress[5]. Another useful way to combat failure is to consult with the change committee. A change committee is a group of representatives from different stakeholders that consult with the project team to provide feedback on the progress of the project. The only issue with these committees is when the different stakeholders do not agree with each other[6].

##Preparing for changes
Backing up old versions of a information system is one of the most foolproof ways of protecting data if a change implementations ultimately falls through. According to an article by Norton Security, wiping data and restoring it to a later backup is much easier to do than debugging potential hundreds of issues [7]. In a similar fashion, since an information system harbors user data, fixing a failed change would be a lot of time and money thus reverting to an old version is more efficient.

## Success!
There are a few things that determine whether your change is ultimately successful. First is that there is a visible sponsor. Second is that there is collaboration among departments within an organization. Finally and the most important indicator is that the overall user community is engaged [8].
