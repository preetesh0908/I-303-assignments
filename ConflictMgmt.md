## Conflict
Conflict is defined as “struggle or friction between two people” [1]. However, that’s a very 
narrow definition and conflicts can occur between a person and thing or even a thing and thing. 
The most common conflicts between people are disagreements.

### Bell & Hart
They came up with 8 causes of workplace conflict in the early 2000s: [2]
Needs
Styles
Perceptions
Goals
Pressures
Roles
Values
Policies

Workplace Tension”. *Mindtools.Com*, https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/eight-causes-
conflict.htm. Accessed 2 Apr. 2019.

#### 1. Needs
    Needs are all about resources that we **need**, be it a physical, monetary, or 
time-based need. Sometimes, it can be related to the effectiveness of your job in various 
regards.

#### 2. Conflicting Styles
    We all do thing a little uniquely (AKA differently). Sometimes these individual methods 
result in **conflicts**. Sometimes you can even have a conflict arise from the way that someone 
approaches another conflict!

#### 3. Conflicting Perceptions
    Everyone sees things differently, and that results in different views on the same issue. 
This often leads to conflicts over existing conflicts- a compounding issue that can be 
disastrous. Sometimes even basic actions, like hiring a new employee, can cause conflict: what 
if an employee interprets this hiring as an indication that their boss isn’t happy with their 
work? That’s a horrible conflict to deal with. 

#### 4. Conflicting Goals
	In many different scenarios, humans have different goals in arguments or conflict. We can have differences in how we measure success in a certain area, we can have opinions about the way we do things, and we can even have different ideas for what everyone should do in a project. In essence, a lot of people want different things, and it is never easy to please everyone. 

#### 5. Conflicting Pressures
	In the same light as people having different goals, we all have different things that pressure us to complete them. Sometimes, deadlines for different goals and different projects are not completely lined up. This causes us to have conflict over the different timelines we all have in our heads. Perhaps, we all can relate to someone who’s trying to complete something with a personal deadline that’s nearer than the normal deadline.

#### 6. Conflicting Roles
	Different people have different occupations and job descriptions, which make their duties overlap, or sometimes it even creates a lapse in duty so no one is actually responsible for it. We have to make the difficult decision of stepping outside our duties, or leaving it for someone else to do. Leaving more work to be put on someone else is bound to be a source of conflict for people who work in groups.

#### 7. Different Personal Values
	As we’ve learned, people are very different in their personal lives. But we also have to consider the fact that people are different in their personal lives. In lecture, we talked about the formation of cliques and organizational gossip. This can lead to rumors that can break personal relationships. In the same lecture, we learned about the best ways to avoid problems like this, avoiding cliques, practicing diversity, and practicing empathy [1].

## Unpredictable Policies

The key driver of conflict is usually misunderstandings between two different parties. One method to combat this from happening is to create policies that have clear boundaries. By having clear boundaries, parties will have strict guidelines that they must adhere to[3]. This will help to establish who is right and wrong in the conflict because the party that disobeyed the policy will ultimately be at fault in the end.

## Conflict with Computer

Conflicts don’t always have to happen between different people. Conflict’s can arise between humans and computers. This can often be represented when people become frustrated with slow speeds, laggy technology, and crashing hardware. These are common problems that companies and individuals face on a day to day basis. These conflicts may be less serious than human to human conflict, or more serious depending on the value of the information at stake in the human to computer conflict.

## Offensive, not Defensive

In the workplace, when there is conflict, it is extremely easy to become aggressive and hostile due to stress. In short, it's much easier in most situations to stay on the offensive instead of the defensive. As a result, if conflict management is not properly administered, then many of these types of conflicts can quickly turn sour. For solutions, by "actively mitigating" and avoiding "waiting for the pot to boil over," most of these aggressive conflicts can be avoided [4a]. This doesn't only apply to professional lives, however it is especially important to have when in the workplace [4b].

##Keep Everyone Updated

One of the most effective ways to avoid conflict even apart from the workplace is to give those who are interested in your life or work frequent updates. In the workplace, conflict tends to arise when there is miscommunication, thus by constantly updating those who need it, communication errors can be avoided thus preventing issues. Frequent updates is especially important when "working with multiple clients or stakeholders" [5].

## Establish Clear Deliverables

Another important way to steer clear of a conflict is to have things and plans organized. One such way of doing this by defining and establishing clear deliverables, such as dividing tasks, delegating work, setting specific due dates, and defining what is expected. It is vital that everyone understands and knows their responsibilities. If someone does not perceive their responsibility, it can cause delay and may result in direct conflict; therefore, it is important to perceive responsibilities.

## Testing the System

It seems clear why there would be a need to test a system before sending it out a client. It is at this testing stage, where one learns what troubles might still be there with the system and helps in troubleshooting those problems. It’s certain that the more intense the testing of the system is, the more refined the system comes out for the client in the end. 
On the other hand, a not-tested system is more likely to create problems for the client. This may result in conflict and deteriorate the relationship, not only with the client, but also with other team members.

## Be Forward

We learned from previous lectures and articles that conflicts usually do not get resolved by themselves. Therefore, it is essential to be forward and actively engage to resolve a conflict or avoid one in the first place. 
It’s understandable that there’s risk associated with it, but is always better to resolve a problem rather than wait to see it become a bigger problem.
