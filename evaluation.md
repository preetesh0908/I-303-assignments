#### Evaluation
In lecture we defined evaluation as being a “Systematic process of determining merit, value, or worth”[1]. As evaluators, the goal is to give an objective judgement on the person, process or thing that we are evaluating.

The purpose of evaluation, or what exactly we want to get from it, is a grade or explanation as to why our person, process, or thing has succeeded or failed in its task.

#### Quantitative Evaluation
Merriam-Webster defines “Quantitative” as “of, relating to, or involving the measurement of quantity or amount”[2]. So, Quantitative Evaluation means to give an objective judgement in terms of a quantity or amount. Types of Quantitative Evaluation discussed in lecture include close-ended surveys, data-mining, and cost-benefit analysis.[1]

#### Data Mining
Data mining is the process of finding valuable trends within large quantities of data. Most modern technology is 
able to subliminally gather trends from consumers. One example of this is coke machines found inside of restaurants. 
The cherry flavored sprite emerged from this technology as Sprite was able to determine that people used these 
drink machines with a flavoring combination [3]. Therefore, the machines are used as mechanisms to mine data 
from consumers as each use is recorded and sent back to pepsi.

#### Cost-benefit Analysis
A cost-benefit analysis is essentially breaking down a situation or scenario into its own risks and rewards. 
For example, one could estimate the amount of money lost each time a college student decides to skip class[4]. 
This analysis is concluded by taking in an annual tuition and estimating the average amount of credit hours a 
normal college student may take. Therefore, cost-benefit analysis allows to evaluate possible trends by using 
specific types of data.

#### Qualitative Research

Qualitative Research is an organized gathering and study of non-numerical research. This type of research pertains to the meanings, concepts, characteristics, symbols, and description of things, rather than their counts or measures, basically the subjective aspects of the data. This is majorly done through means like open-ended surveys.

#### Open-ended Surveys

Open-ended surveys usually start with broad and general questions and narrow it down to specifications and through the means of rapports, they make patterns and conclusions based on the same. One factor that makes open-ended surveys important is that the responses and their patterns evolve and change with time. People tend to change their responses with time, and this affects the conclusion and therefore the business practices.
One important factor of making the most of these open-ended surveys is to ask the right questions at the right time.

#### Qualitative Research: Beginning Research

Start with a broad goal or series of questions. If you’re too narrow then you may miss 
information that could ultimately be very important or add new questions to your inquiry.
As you search you can refine it and get a better idea of your search’s purpose. When
dealing with people it is important to walk in their shoes and understand their perspective(s).
You should spend time with the person and build rapport, and familiarize yourself with their 
mental workings:
Their processes for doing things
Attitudes
Disposition
Etc.

Eventually you’ll be able to understand not just *how* they do things, by *why*.

It can be difficult to begin research, especially since most people feel the need to be specific 
from the beginning. But as mentioned, this should be avoided. A big piece of research is asking 
“*Why?*”. And be sure to record your findings in whatever method suits you and your research 
best. 

Qualitative Sources can be (these are common ones):
Observation
Open-ended interviews
Open-ended surveys
Artifacts (Documents, maps, etc)

#### Observations
These are when you observe someone going about a task, much like a job-shadow. You don’t 
have to remain silent, as you can ask questions about what/why someone is doing something, 
as clarifying the task is as important as observing it. First had observations are preferred so you 
can look for what you know matters most to your research. 

#### Open Ended Interviews & Surveys

These can either be informal (loosely structured and conversational) or formal (exactly the 
opposite). The great thing about it being face to face is you can have the subject describe things 
in their own words and ask for clarifications on whatever they say. Non-verbal cues like tone of 
voice and facial movements can say a lot too. Surveys are less informative but can provide a lot 
of information quickly (depending on deployment method) and cheaply. 

#### Artifacts

These are just documents like job descriptions, rule/regulations (employee handbooks), training 
materials, and employee systems. You can even look at non-document media like photos, 
floorplans, etc. These can, in certain circumstances, help with interviews. 

A great example of an artifact is the Indiana University developed Personnel Informational 
Environment that is in use by some IU departments. Even though development was completed 
in 2010 [6], deployment of the system to other branches is still ongoing, with the first 
Bloomington departments to have used it was a customer service department within University 
Information Technology Services: Technology Center Consulting [7]. It has a lot of information 
that could be vital to those with access doing research that could benefit the department using 
it.

#### Is it Valid? Validating Qualitative Analysis

Due to qualitative analysis being inherently unobjective relative to its quantitative counterpart, researchers ultimately need a way to validate their findings when using this form of data collection. In many cases, qualitative analysis can be described as a "researcher's interpretation of… [a] phenomenon" [8] after they have conversed with others and studied a myriad of documents. As a result, one may question how validating subjective forms of data collection such as interviews, surveys, etc. is possible.

#### Combining both together & Validation (cont.)

Comparing quantitative results with qualitative data is possibly the most popular form of doing mass validation. Essentially evaluating both quantitative and qualitative results side-by-side "can yield strong insight into many domains" [8]. For example, collecting certain data from a survey or interview one person, can be compared to an overall larger population pool (gathered by statistics) and can ultimately be extrapolate how that one person fares with the average.

Quantitative and qualitative combination is not the only method of validation, another one of the most commonly employed strategies when validating qualitative data includes a "strategy known as triangulation" [9]. Triangulation can be defined as using "multiple sources and methods to cross-validate" [8] or "any technique that would inform the results from different angles" [9]. As mentioned earlier, there other means of validating data in addition to quantitative comparison and triangulation. Some of these things would include methods such as getting feedback in the form respondent validation (which is essentially just having the subject who were observed view the research results), gathering rich data (another way to say to "collect lots of data" [8]), and ultimately finding "alternative explanations to what appear to be research results" [9].
