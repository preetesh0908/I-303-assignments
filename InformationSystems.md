### Defining Information Systems
In order to understand what an information system is, one must understand how 
it differs from information technology. An information system essentially is 
the combination of information technology and software to "support the goals 
of an organization"[1]. Thus in short, information technology is nested under 
information systems and ultimately used as a support tool. However, like 
information technologies, information systems come in many types such as 
transactional systems, functional systems, integrated systems and much more.

### Transactional and Functional Systems
A transactional system is essentially one of many convenient information systems 
that takes over the tedious tasks that an organization could have. Some of these 
tasks include "collection, modification and retrieval of all transaction data" [2] 
which includes things such as accounting and payroll [3]. Functional systems are 
an expansion of transactional systems. They effectively are the facilitated function 
of department, so rather than payroll, it would be a human resource department 
running payroll and basic accounting would become a transition to a larger scale 
in the form of financial reporting [4].

### Integrated Systems
An integrated system is a type of information system that utilizes multiple subsets 
of information to achieve a desired goal. An example of this type of system would 
be a Customer Relationship Management system.[5] In order for this particular type
 of system to be in place, there must be data collected from the customers which 
could include names, dates, and possible relations to the company as well as dates
 visited, possible transactions that may have occurred. Data would also need to be
 collected from the company’s side to manage this system. Simply put, integration 
from both parties is necessary for this system to exist.

### Customer Relationship Model
A customer relationship model is essential for every business to succeed. It gathers
 data from current and past customers to identify useful trends to improve a 
business’s future and current relationships with their customers. The key is 
gathering the right information from this type of model to identify the most useful 
trends and tendencies of customers.[6]

### ERP
ERP stands for *Enterprise Resource Planning*. An ERP essentially is the backline 
system of any company. This could include the technology mainframe of a company as
 well the management of all applications associated with a company. ERPs are often
 used by larger companies and require a smaller team to manage all aspects of the 
the system itself.[7] Teams are expected to handle deployment, operation, as well 
as installing newer versions of the system in order for a business to run properly.

What's the Difference? Webopedia, www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/ERP.html

### EAI
*Enterprise Application Integration* acts as a form of middleware between a company’s 
database and the information. Essentially, it acts as a linking system between 
different applications and databases within a company. It is known that most project
 management teams provide EAI support in order for a company to run efficiently and 
smoothly.[8] Another way to think about this system is the “chain” between different
 nodes of a company. The nodes are the data access points and using EAI, companies 
can transfer different information across the nodes.

### Early Views of Organization in IS
The earliest principle developed that applies to organization within a company is 
the Managerial Theory which states that a system needs to act in a rational and 
logistic manner.[9] Another way to think of this is each piece of a company is a 
puzzle and needs to fit in with the bigger picture. Therefore, each branch of a 
company needs to a logical place in the company, or else a company will fail due
 to overmanagement, and a data surplus. This principle applies to sectors in an
 information system because by having too many sectors to monitor and control, a 
system will become too difficult to maintain and manage. Politics are ignored, and
 the functionality of the company is prioritized rather than a companies own beliefs.

### Centralization vs. Decentralization
Each company’s system is classified as either a centralized system or a decentralized
 system. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of system structure. A 
centralized system relies on a singular individual to manage and make decisions for
 the entire company or system, while a decentralized system takes into consideration
 the input from multiple sources or outlets in a system.[10] Larger companies with
 multiple branches would most likely benefit from a decentralized system, as there 
are too many branches for a single individual to manage and keep track of, while a 
smaller business may benefit from a singular individual to make all necessary 
decisions for a company.

## The Four Views

### Technological View
This view focuses on the hardware, software, and networks of information systems. 
Technology is the most important piece of the puzzle as it works together with an 
organization.

### Social View
This view focuses on the human side of the information system. For example, this 
would include the purpose we give to the information that is being processed and
 the results or data that we achieve as a result. In lecture, it was described to
 us as the “agency of us in social context”.[11]

[11]Paul, Logan. “Week 6.” I303 Lecture. Bloomington, IN. 2-15-2019. Lecture.

### Sociotechnical View
This view focuses on the combination of the two previous views. This view believes
 that an information system will fail without the consideration of both. This
 ensures success in the future so neither side is neglected.

### Process View
This view focuses on the processes that the information system aims to complete. 
This view looks at the highways on which information travels and how it is 
manipulated in order to reach the end goal.[12]

### Old Style

In the early years of the internet, users would primarily use the internet to 
connect with different people via emails. In the business world on the hand, 
the use of the internet was again mostly for communicating purposes within the
 organization. What a user now imagines the internet to be is remotely different
 from the “old style” internet. From e-commerce, flight bookings, information, 
to online dating, college applications, job searching, everything has changed on 
the internet. And what’s even more to it, the internet is still growing each day 
to be a better source for interaction and communication.

### Internet Growth

In the 1990s, a lot of the internet focused on HTML web sites and, by the later 1990s, 
transmission of data between programs (e-mail, Instant Messengers, etc). There weren’t 
streaming services and what we have today until torrenting began in 2001- it was primarily 
informational in its earlier days.[13] Youtube was deployed in 2005 and was promptly bought by
 Google in 2006 for $1.65 billion. [14] The first video uploaded was of a man at the Zoo (one of 
the founders).

As time went on and consumer focused services like Skype and Wikipedia emerged, the Internet
 stopped being just an informational service as it had much more to offer to consumers on a 
communication, entertainment, and productivity level. But as it transitioned from being a service 
that businesses primarily used (in its very early days), lines that seperate its “departments” (who 
it serves, whose it is, what it’s for) began to blur. 

Google is a great example: it’s a internet-born Information System that is hardly classifiable as 
transactional, functional, or integrated because it may be any of those to any person. They 
provide a different service to many different groups with many different purposes. They serve 
consumers, businesses, governments…. essentially everyone in some way.
