#### What is a Team?
A team is often confused with the concept of a group. While groups are organizations of 
people, like teams, they lack the common goal that a team has. A team consists of 3 or 
more people whose skills and talents are combined and focused at a common goal. Teams are 
created for both long term and short term goals, in the business world, it�s usually to 
create or provide a good or service to the consumer.^

#### Team Communication and Coordination
Communication is one of the most important traits of a team. As discussed in lecture^, 
teams are required to pass information between the members of the team, and how often, and 
how formal it is becomes very important. Teams that are open with each other and have 
spontaneous and informal discussions are set up early for success.

Team Coordination also plays a big part in how successful teams become. Successful teams 
often have a schedule they create in order to plan the short and long term goals of a 
project. Using this schedule allows team members to give status reports on how they are 
accomplishing their goals, measured in both quality and speed of completion.

#### Team Contributions, Support, Effort and Overall Cohesion
No successful team has a single person doing all the work. In fact, "most tasks [that have
 any significant value] cannot be done in isolation." (Westside Toastmasters) This being
  said, every member on a team must develop more of an open minded, "team mentality" in 
  order to make any sort of progress on a task. Even if the thought may not seem like the 
  best idea brought to the table, respecting all values and contributions without pride is 
  quintessential to uplifting other team members and to productivity within the team. 
Having pride and bravado simply weigh a team down, in that it causes unnecessary conflict 
  with increasingly difficult resolution. Rather than bashing certain ideas, approaching 
  all types of teamwork and meetings with positivity enhances the effectiveness of 
communication, problem solving, and decision making (Westside Toastmasters). According to 
  an article provided by LinkedIn, most "project work is often fluid and free flowing." 
  Thus when people struggle, contributing positivity and assistance increases the chances of 
  success to a project. (Kuijsters, 2015)

Nothing done on a team is a competition since everyone is working towards a common (team) 
goal and thus if all team members develop a "I want to be on the team" mentality an 
organic psychological environment of "shared expectations" is developed and ultimately the 
success of a team project is more guaranteed (Lecture).

#### Team Composition
There’s a lot of managerial work involved within a team. Someone (the team leader) has to 
consider the relevant personalities and skill sets of the other team members, while also 
weighing the individual's goals and interests. All together, you use these factors to 
assign roles and delegate tasks to boost the team’s productivity. That’s why choosing an 
effective leader is one of the most important tasks.^

^Joesph, C. *Importance Of A Leader In A Team*. The Chron - Hearst Newspapers, 28 Jan. 
2019, https://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-leader-team-52168.html.

One of those factors, *Personalities*, is extremely important. As we discussed in 
lecture^, these are the important pieces of a person;s personality to look at:
- Extroversion vs Introversion
- Sensing vs Intuition
- Thinking vs Feeling
- Judging vs Perceiving

^Logan, Paul. “Week 3.” I303 Lecture. Bloomington, IN. 28-1-2019. Lecture.

Depending on the various roles/tasks your team must perform, you want a certain mix of 
these traits.
#### Spaces and Places
The two big variations of a workspace today are *Closed* and *Open*. A closed workspace is 
your traditional office with cubicles and private offices that all offer some semblance of 
privacy. An open workspace is like what you find at those spaces designed/operated by 
**WeWork**.

I prefer a closed workspace because I like having my own personal space to work in. I’ve 
found I’m the most productive when I have a quiet personal space to work in. 

*Related remark*: I remember reading an article a-while ago that said that these open plan 
offices actually decrease communication levels between employees. The reason given was 
when you remove their privacy, like they get in a closed office design, they retract into 
themselves a bit more to try and scrounge together whatever privacy they can get. I do not 
have a citation for this, it was just something I remembered while writing this. 

#### Forming
According Bruce Tuckman, a researcher in group dynamics, each team has different *phases*
that it transitions in and out of. The first stage is known as Forming, where formalities 
between team members are exchanged and. This stage can basically be depicted as the 
“ice-breaker” stage where members of the team get to know one another and discover 
the characteristics that each person brings to the team (Lecture). Leadership within 
this stage is very important, because with a new group often comes unfamiliarity which 
causes difficulty when making decisions necessary for the whole group. So, an outspoken 
leader who can manage crowds easier would be an ideal figure to guide the group during this 
phase.

#### Storming
The stage that follows the *Forming* stage is known as the Storming Phase. This stage 
is notorious for failures within most groups because this is often when workstyles 
between team members combat. One team members approach to a problem may also differ 
with that of his peers. It is essential to establish a solid leader at this point as their 
role may be challenged by another team member. The unclear relationship boundaries often 
leave team members confused and unsure of whether they will be able to continue working with 
their current team (Lecture). If this stage is passed, however, a team may be able to succeed. 

#### Norming
Norming is the stage when relationships between members are more solidified and secure. 
Members may start to socialize more and consult one another for explanations, guidelines, 
and general help. Differences are generally resolved, and if the leader has maintained their 
position, they will likely be respected by other members for their commitment and determination 
in ensuring the group succeeds. However, this phase does not guarantee a team’s success. As 
new tasks arise within a group, there may be periods when the team reverts back to the 
previous stage of storming (Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing).

#### Performing
Performing is the final stage reached when a team has managed to surpass every other stage. 
At this point, a team is run fluently, with little instruction, and with little oversight. 
The team leader has established his expectations for the group and has earned the respect of 
every member (Lecture). Moreover, future tasks can be handled with minimal instruction 
because of the team’s chemistry and relationship. This stage is the result of a team 
previously accomplishing a task given to them (Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing).

#### Team Status
I believe our team is somewhere between the lines of Norming and Storming. We have established 
a general leader of the group as he remains very organized and establishes roles for each 
member of the team. With that being said, our team has also had a few minor bumps in the 
road, but we overcame them and seem to be doing well at this point.

#### Getting Ready as a Team
To get ready as a team, the team-members must set or define a goal, give members their roles and set a deserving leader, define responsibilities, decide the strategy and planning of the team, among other things that are important to set a smooth start. Even more so important is to implement these strategies and cooperate on them to ensure commitment and unity as a team.

#### Measuring Team Performance
A team, however competent, is not a “team” until it can perform tasks, give results, and is efficient and responsible for the performance. But, how does one measure the team performance? What are the criteria for measuring these performances? In general, there are two criteria for measuring performances:
###### Process Performance
This measure entails the efficiency of the process. For example, this measure would entail checking whether the process was done under a given time, whether it was done under the assigned budget, whether it was critiqued and reviewed as a team, etc.
###### Product Performance
This measure would entail in determining to check whether the final product is working, to check if the product meets the requirements and purpose of the clients or customers, to check if the product is worth the cost, etc

For our team, we have ensured to review and share opinions about other’s work before submitting, to take responsibility for the work done, to ascertain that the work is delivered and submitted on time, etc.

#### Organizational Theory
This section discusses the importance of the three concepts of Organizational Theory,
..*Bureaucratic; It is a complex approach that has the aspects hierarchy, of the process being rigid about rules and structure, there being specialized personnel, a division of labor, etc.
..*Project Management; This style has the aspects of different parts being done by different people, yet being under one project manager. This benefits the team in building up communication, and have dynamic experiences of the project.
..*Matrix; This is what is an approach that is balanced between bureaucratic and project management. This is considered to be more efficient than the other two as it is creative and creates a sense of unity.
