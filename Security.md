## Trust

When you choose to use someone else’s software, you’re placing some of your trust in their 
hands. *Trust* is defined here as giving up some of your control to someone else in a situation.
Example: Everyone trusted TurboTax with their information when using their software, and they
broke that trust when their data was hacked and stolen.

There’s risk associated with the exchange of trust between people: what if someone lies,
misrepresents, or misleads you? 

When anywhere, you are generally trusting your surroundings and the people within them as
being safe and posing no harm (unless you’re consciously aware that you’re in a bad
neighborhood). You can also trust a thing: the examples given in lecture were of flying in Hot Air
Balloons (hoping it doesn’t rip), flying in a plane (hoping it doesn’t crash), and Roller Coasters
(hoping it doesn’t kill you). [1]

## Online Ticketing

Online Ticketing is an example where we place a lot of faith (*trust*) into computers: you trust
that the computer is doing its job accurately and that the ticket it gives you after taking some of
your money is valid and will allow you into the event. It requires your trust in the **digital**
process (buying the ticket online) and the **physical** process (using the ticket to get in). 

## Credit Cards

Credit Cards are a great example of our blind trust in technology. Most people have one and
they use it everywhere trusting that the card’s information won’t be swiped (RFID scans the
information off your magnetic strip and copies it) and used fraudulently, and that the Credit Card
company will be responsible in the handling of your very sensitive data (bank connections,
purchase information, etc). In recent years swipe cards have been replaced with the more
secure chip cards that are much harder to swipe. People put this same trust in the newer (and
supposedly more secure [2]) mobile wallets on their phones.

## Visible vs Invisible

We tend to trust things that we are able to see, like a safe or a locked door. We like to trust them because we know exactly what’s going on, However with a computer or a website, it’s harder to trust them because we can’t really see what’s going on behind the scenes. Some of the things we’ve discussed in lecture are the fact that we’re not able to develop interpersonal relationships with computers yet. However, we are beginning to develop business relationships with them[1].

## Who Has Your Data?

We are very willing to share our information on the internet these days. Why? Perhaps it’s because we haven’t had our identities stolen or our personal information leaked yet. This is good, however, it’s shouldn’t inhibit our goal of keeping our personal information secure. According to a 2018 article by the Guardian, Google knows where we’ve been, everything we’ve searched (Even if we deleted it), and has all of your YouTube history.[3]

### Risk Analysis

In life, there are events or instances that could happen every day which can impact one’s life 
from mild to severe. Luckily, we as society have been able to identify a cumulative process that 
can gauge whether an activity is too risky, moderately risky, or hardly risky at all. This process 
is defined as a *Risk Analysis*. A risk Analysis essentially rates an activity or event based on 
the probability of the event happening multiplied by the score one deems for the impact it would 
have their life. This is a useful process in a corporate setting because it allows for companies 
to deem whether a new project should be executed, if an employee should be hired, or for general 
security purposes of the company[4]. By identifying appropriate risks, a company can therefore prioritize their 
resources accordingly and plan for the future[5].

## Common/Best Practices

There are many risks that are widespread across different organizations. This could be a data breach, 
building fire, or any sort of weather related incident. Therefore, when handling such widespread risks, 
there are often *Best Practices* one should conduct when dealing with these certain risks. Obviously 
the case for a company fire would be to equip a facility with a fire extinguisher as well as having the 
fire department easily able to be reached. An example like this represents a *Common Practice*[6].

## Mitigating Risks

On the topic of Risk Analysis, there are methods to minimize or decrease the probability of a risk occurring. 
A common example of mitigating a risk could be moving electronics away from a bathtub to avoid the risk of 
being electrocuted. The same practices can be applied in a business scenario. In order to decrease the 
likelihood of a data breach occuring, a company may employ a team to monitor the security of the data 
and employ new patches to address problems within the code[7].

## Going through case scenarios
## Deadly Sins (pt2)

## Establish a policy

When protecting information in the technological world, creating a policy is important in that it "gets everyone on the same page" [8] as it is the "starting point for all rules/regulations" [8]. One of the scenarios that was presented to the lecture was a situation where someone recorded a lot of important information on an unsecure web server "on accident." As the person who discovered it, if you were to report the situation, you would unfortunately be targeted as someone who was not working hard or at all, but it's important that it be reported since it contains other people's personal information. The difficult part for this situation is determining whether or not it's appropriate to report the situation. Most responses to this question involved reporting the one who left the information out on an unsecure server. Essentially most of the logic behind choosing to report it was that doing the right thing would ultimately weigh out protecting potential irreparable damage.

## Monitor and Enforce
Another necessity to ensure security in data, "adequate ways to monitor" information such as "access log audits, [creating] password expiration [dates] and have proper network management" [8]. In addition to this, constantly monitoring all of these methods is just as important as implementing them. One of the biggest proponents of stolen information lies in when people leave companies on bad terms. Thus monitoring and locking them from their passwords after they leave is extremely important. Another step that can be taken in securing this information is to have an "exit interview with every employee who leaves and remind them of" what most companies have as a "non-disclosure contract" [9]. Ultimately monitoring and enforcing methods of information security is important and will provide as a solid backbone when trying to protect data.

## When Things Go Wrong?
Often times, there may be complications which may result in some kind of harm, if not always physical harm, for example, there could be a machine error where the machine sends out some critical information to some of its customers. This, although a severe situation, should not just be blamed on the software.

## Who to Blame?
It’s true that softwares and machines are supposed to be more objective and better than human outputs in carrying out some tasks, but at the same time it should be acknowledged that these machines were designed by humans in the first place, which may have mistakes and some kind of human subjectivities associated with it.
There are many dynamics that come with the evolution of technology, for example, as discussed in class, a Tesla would likely hit a kid on a narrow bridge on auto-pilot if the bridge does not have any visible supports. The gist of the example being, even though in a situation like this, one should not just blame the machine for it, for the machine was in fact programmed to act in the way, as maybe certain dynamics did not come into the plan with it.
